The assumption is that 
  
   ixa0,iya0   ixa1,iya0    [is next to]  ixb0,iyb0   ixb1,iyb0 
   ixa0,iya0   ixa1,iya1                  ixb0,iyb0   ixb1,iyb1    

ie, that index ix1 of image a is adjacent index ix0 of image b.
It is allowed for ix1<ix0.

If :DIRECTION is :VERTICAL, then 
   
   ixa0,iya0   ixa1,iya0  
   ixa0,iya0   ixa1,iya1
         [is above]
   ixb0,iyb0   ixb1,iyb0
   ixb0,iyb0   ixb1,iyb1 

In each case, the distance is 'GAP'
