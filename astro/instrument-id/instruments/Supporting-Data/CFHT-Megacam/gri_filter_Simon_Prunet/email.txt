was having problems calibrating the P2010V1 images for gri.

I contacted Simon Prunet at CFHT and he graciously computed a transformation from
g,r,i to  gri_AB  that seems to work very accurately for all 131 classes of Pickles stellar spectra.

This will allow valid AB calibration of any megacam gri images given an SDSS or 
PS1 catalog.

This is the formula, simplified

   F_g := 0.01551 10^(-0.4*g)  ;; catalog sdss AB g to flux
   F_r := 0.01400 10^(-0.4*r)  ;; catalog sdss AB r to flux
   F_i := 0.01020 10^(-0.4*i)  ;; catalog sdss AB i to flux

   Fgri := 1.5256 * F_g +  1.5969 * F_r +  0.7877 * F_i   ;; gri flux
   MagAB_gri= -2.5 log10(Fgri/0.05392)  ;; desired true AB gri mag of catalog star
  

The other direction, going from calibrated gri to r-band object magnitude, is still undefined, and would require
assumptions about an objectâ€™s spectrum, but that would be true about inferring (eg) g from r.

We should remember to put Simon in the acknowledgements.

Hi Jan,

below are some results for a decomposition of the flux F_gri in to F_g, F_r, F_i. 
(where g,r,i use the SDSS 2.5m transmission spectra)

Fitting a linear model on synthetic fluxes using Pickles spectra, I get the following decomposition:

F_gri =   1.5256 * F_g +  1.5969 * F_r +  0.7877 * F_i

These fluxes can be derived from the AB magnitudes by:
F_b = F_b(ref) x 10^(-0.4*m_b) 
where m_b is the AB magnitude in the band b, and F_b(ref) = \int \lambda T_b(\lambda) S_AB(\lambda) d\lambda.

The values of F_b(ref) are respectively:
0.05392, 0.01551, 0.01400, 0.01020 
for gri, g_sdss, r_sdss, i_sdss. These flux are in arbitrary (but identical !) units, so they can be used in the equations above to 
predict gri AB magnitudes from SDSS g, r, i AB magnitudes.

I attach a few figures, the first one gives the gri transmission, as well as the SDSS g,r,i transmissions (these include in principle all the optics + atmosphere).

The second and third figure give F_gri (dark blue line), the above linear fit (magenta) and its decomposition in terms of weighted F_g (red), F_r(green) and F_i(cyan)
for all stars in the Pickles library.

The third gives the fit residuals.

Let me know if this addresses your problem, or if you need me to compute other quantities.

Best regards,

	Simon
