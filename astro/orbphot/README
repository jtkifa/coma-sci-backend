Package for automated photometry on moving objects

(orbphot:do-auto-phot fits-file)  looks up the OBJECT name
in a fits file, gets the orbit from MPC, and computes
sextractor photometry.

It expects PHOT-CALIB headers for the zeropoint, and uses 
the INSTRUMENT-ID package to get the mjd, object name, 
and observatory.
