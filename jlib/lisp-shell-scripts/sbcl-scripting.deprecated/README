A framework for scripts in SBCL.

A /bin/sh script (sbcl-shell-script-example) runs
a Lisp file  (sbcl-shell-script-example.lisp) in the same
directory.

The environment variable $SBCL determines which sbcl to use,
reverting to `which sbcl` if not set.

In the Lisp file, (load-user-init) optionally load's the user's
.sbclrc, and *script-name* is set to the name of the Lisp source
script, and *script-arguments* is a list of command line arguments.
